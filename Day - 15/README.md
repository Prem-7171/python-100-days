## Day 15 – Coffee Machine project.

- Build a console-based **Coffee Machine** program that can:
  - Show a report of available resources.
  - Process coin input and handle payments.
  - Check if there are enough resources to make a drink.
  - Deduct ingredients and update profit after each purchase.

### Concepts Practiced

- Working with dictionaries and nested data structures (`MENU`, `resources`).
- Writing and organizing functions for:
  - Checking resources
  - Processing coins
  - Validating transactions
  - Making coffee (updating resources)  
- While loops and user input handling for continuous program execution.
