# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# = i take the values from 1 to 19, if i == 20 it prints a statement, but it would never happen as i dosent inherit value 20
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#  = when i == 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# = I takes values from 1 to 19, not 20
